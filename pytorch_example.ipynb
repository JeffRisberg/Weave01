    "1. Storing hyperparameters and metadata in a `config`.\n",
    "2. Tracking your model with `wandb.watch` to automatically log your model gradients and parameters. We'll also grab bunch of system metrics, like GPU and CPU utilization.\n",
    "3. Using the `wandb.log` API to log everything else, like the loss.\n",
